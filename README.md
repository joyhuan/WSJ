# The Wall Street Journal

Throughout my childhood, my weekend routine has been ruminating on the Southern Weekly my father brought home. Southern Weekly is special both in its appearance and contents. Its pages are unusually huge, images unusually appealing, and contents unusually thought-provoking. There are many aspects that I appreciate. One of the most special aspects is its lens. The weekly newspaper normally reflects a social event from the perspective of a single person or family. I can resonate and live their life vicariously. That was so powerful and left me think deep about the impact and implications of any reformations. Though I learnt its editorial guideline --"Justice, Conscience, Love, Rationality" – many years after I read it, I think it adheres to its principle pretty well.

When I applied for college, I chose my major as math and society, wishing to use data analysis to better allocation resources. However, I found out academia society is too aloft. I felt some debates among the Ivy League privileges kids are groundless and prejudiced. My friends who had wines paired with steak for dinner would often complain about how evil rich people are and how exploited they felt. Doesn’t “Let them eat cake” sound familiar? 

Reality is a sphere puzzle to me. Each of us is limited by our backgrounds and circumstances. That’s why perspectives and opinions are important. We may never get to the truth, but with more thoughts, we can eliminate more fallacies and better converge to it. We may even reconstruct the past and approximate the future. Most importantly, we stay true to fact as much as we can, fighting to not giving in to our inclined biases. That’s epic. 

I have an ingrained desire to figure out the cause of a subset of cultural phenomena, among them equality, social mobility, capitalism, communism, and emerging markets are always top priority. It took me many years to find resources to learn more about the topics. I still haven’t found many, but I have plenty at hand to digest. With that, I will be content with what I have now and absorb them before moving on to more involved insights.
